Without any doubt, I vouch for PTE to be an easier exam. Moreover, if you are more comfortable with computers than humans then go for it. It doesn’t mean that the one who sits a lot on computer or knows a lot about Computer, it means if you are more comfortable speaking to a machine than speaking or giving a test in front of a person.

Because a person judging your English, or any skills will make you bit uncomfortable, and you may start stuttering/stammering.

Also, I believe PTE to be more fair and real test of English. There are 71 questions asked in PTE Academic in 20 formats divided into 4 sections. PTE computing engine evaluates everyone equally and fairly as it is algorithm based unlike humans who might build preconceived notions based on attire, body language and facial expressions.

There are rumors that as IELTS exams across the world are conducted by humans and those humans needs regular salary, they have significantly lower profits than internet-based exams like TOEFL, IBT or PTE. Hence, to generate more profits, they play with test-takers money by tricking them with low score in one of the sections of test but making fine overall score. Most of the people have taken IELTS at least 2 times in their life to get the desired score.

Disclaimer: I do not claim or support these rumors, in my belief tests are conducted fairly.

Most importantly, it is easier to score in PTE Academic. 65+ in PTE is equivalent to 7.0 in IELTS. Trust me 65+ is fairly easy with 7 days of practice and learning and practice.
