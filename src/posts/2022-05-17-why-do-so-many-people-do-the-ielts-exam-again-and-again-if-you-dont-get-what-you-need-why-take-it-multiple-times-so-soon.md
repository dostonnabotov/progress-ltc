In my experience of working with International students, there is a substantial minority of them who think of the IELTS test as being rather like throwing dice when playing a board game.

They need a double six to start, and they don't get it. So they throw again. And again. And again!

They are firmly convinced that eventually they will be lucky, and the dice will come up with the IELTS score that they need. And it honestly does not seem to occur to them that actually doing some real work for it would be much cheaper, and much more likely to succeed.

In fairness, I should say that most of my experience has been with Chinese students, who believe very strongly in luck. Indian students on Quora are more inclined to believe that it's a money-making racket, and that the examiners fail them repeatedly, in order to force them to spend more money. They are convinced they are being cheated, they are angry about it, and they want to know what special trick will enable them to go from a 5.5 to an 8.0 in two weeks. Some of them set up websites marketing ‘genuine’ fake certificates, which they advertise on Quora as a money-making response to these people. Some of us spend a lot of time spotting these posts and Reporting them as the Spam they are!

Ultimately, the only answers involve time, work, practice and effort. But not many people like those as answers, which is why they go on rolling the dice.
