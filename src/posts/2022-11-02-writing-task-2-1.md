### Writing Task 2

Some people say that if old people spend time, get along with others, and exercise everyday they will become fit. However, nowadays old people are usually alone and do not talk to others which make them unhappy and unfit. Causes and solutions?

### Plan: Paraphrase + template

lack of attention/ younger members are busy/ can’t spare enough time for lengthy conversation/ little common topics/ Don’t receive enough support/ most facilities are senior unfriendly  

teach elderly IT skills/ most younger spend time socializing on the internet/ if old people are computer literate, they can enlarge their social circles/ authorities should set up sporting facilities designed for elderly use/ promote healthy life style through media involving older celebrities to emulate

### A﻿ctual Essay:

It is believed by some that if senior citizens spare time socializing with other people and engage in sports activities, these help their mental and physical wellbeing. Nevertheless, most elderly today feel miserable and lonely, habitually distancing themselves from others in conversation. This essay will discuss the main causes of this problem and then describe the possible solutions.

In my opinion, the foremost causes of loneliness among the elderly are negligence and lack of support. To begin with, old people are not able to talk with younger in common topics owing to the age gap and varied interests. Most youths prefer to spend time chatting on the social network about current events, while the old like to have a lengthy conversation reminiscing good old times. Such differences further the gap between generations and bring conversation among both parties to a minimum. Another cause for the social distancing of the elderly is little support to engage older citizens with exercising facilities. Most gyms and fitness centers target young adults and are not user friendly for people of respectful age. As a result, in absence of such sporting facilities, old people spend most of their time secluded from others and leading hedonistic lifestyle.

The possible solutions of this problem include promoting adult education programs and creation of special facilities for old people. Initially, old citizens could be taught computer literacy which helps them socialize online. Empowered with necessary IT skills, retired citizens would be able to grow their social circles and never feel alone. Furthermore, state authorities could set up sporting facilities designed for the elderly where they can do basic work out and stretching exercises. Promotion of such facilities through media by older celebrities could draw many old people to such places and treat their health and vitality carefully.

To sum up, loneliness and health issues are common problems that affect a lot of elderly nowadays. It is mainly caused by age differences among generations and lack of provision for health activities. I believe this problem could be tackled by teaching basic computer literacy and creation of health facilities designed for the old population.
