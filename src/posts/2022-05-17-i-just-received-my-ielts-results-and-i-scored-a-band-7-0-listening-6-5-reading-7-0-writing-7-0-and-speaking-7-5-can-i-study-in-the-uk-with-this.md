Well, as an English qualification it would be fine, no problem at all. Most UK universities want a minimum of 6.5 overall, which is roughly equivalent to a decent GCSE English grade, so 7.0 is fine.

However, that is just the basic language qualification. Nobody in the UK goes to university just because they've managed to pass GCSE English. On top of that, they need to prove that they have Maths to the same sort of standard (everyone has to have both of those, whatever subject they want to study at university), plus usually three good A levels in subjects relevant to their chosen university subject. International students use their equivalent qualifications, which UK universities can accept.

For the OP, I would expect this to mean probably NECO or possibly WASSEC exams. But something comparable to A levels, at any rate. IELTS is a good start, but only a start.
