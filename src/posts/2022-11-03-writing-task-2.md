### Writing Task 2

Some people believe the purpose of education is to prepare people to be useful members for society. Others say that the purpose of education is to achieve personal ambitions. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

### Plan: Paraphrase + template

prerequisite for employment/the presence of job reduces the number of poor people/educated person contributes rather than relying on others/specialize in their field/do their job for the benefit of the society/prosperity for the whole community.

I think personal motivation is the main drive /People are career oriented/Choice of study depends on personal goals/eg; money, power, fame, status/international relations considering presidents,prime minister as role model

Purpose of education varies, but I believe it is personally motivated for many people

### Aï»¿ctual Essay:

Some think that university education should prepare its alumni to contribute to the society, while others argue stating the main purpose of education is related to self-realization. While there are valid arguments in support of both statements, I believe achieving individual goals is a key motivation for many people.

On the one hand, the proof of a certain degree of schooling is already a prerequisite for most office related jobs at present. University graduates improve their chances for employment with a qualification obtained in a specific sphere. With the number of educated employees increasing, the bar set for the standards of the services will increase, and the whole community could enjoy better utilities from qualified specialists. Moreover, citizens remain economically stable as long as they have their jobs. As a result, workers with educational experience contribute to their society through taxes and services rather than demanding monetary benefits.    

From another angle, I believe that personal interest prevails when pursuing tertiary education. Most people orient their chosen field of studies based on their future career. While it is financial wealth for some, others are after fame and see education as a precursor of their status symbol. Students majoring in fields such as politics and international relations, for instance, reason their choice with someone in power they strive to emulate and wish to have similar degree of influence on people around them. This further proves the point that many people are mainly goal oriented for their self-realization while pursuing an academic degree.

In conclusion, although self-effacing benevolence for the community is a valid purpose of education for some, I think getting proper education is personally motivated for many people.
