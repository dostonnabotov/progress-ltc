**DON’T DO THIS:**

Don’t copy the behavior of other people because how they study does not automatically make it the right thing for you. This applies to all those students who claim they study 12, 15, or 20 hours a day and post their study sessions on YouTube to gain followers. They focus only on quantity i.e. number of hours, which does not guarantee success. And, they don’t talk about how sleep deprivation negatively impacts memory and recall of study material.

**DO THIS INSTEAD:**

Create a reasonable study plan that you can actually put into practice every day. This takes a little bit of time to set up, but it will save you time and energy that goes into wondering how to structure your study sessions day by day. Also, a good study plan won’t make you feel exhausted, demotivated, overwhelmed, and scared about what will happen during exam week.

**How do you create a reasonable study plan?**

* **Simplify what you need to do in one day.**

The best way to get your mind focused on what’s important to successfully pass your exams is to start the day with a question, “What is the **ONE** thing I am committed to completing today?”

Here’s why. This question will encourage you to think strategically about the day, keep you focused on your top study goal, and force you to prioritize the one goal you want to reach. It doesn’t mean that you don’t have many study goals, but it does means that you can finish one today (read a certain number of chapters or practice exam questions, for example), so that you can concentrate better on your other goals in the days that follow.
Here’s how to practice it. Write the question in big letters on a sheet of paper and hang it on a wall. Pick a location where you can easily see it as soon as you wake up (next to your bed or the bathroom mirror, for example). Then, read it out loud as you start your day. Take a few moments to think what you want to prioritize, come up with an answer and say it out loud too. 

* **Learn how to take good notes.**

Don’t just sit and read the textbook. Taking notes as you’re reading improves your brain's cognitive skills, makes retention of information easier, and boosts memory.
